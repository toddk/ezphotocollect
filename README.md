#  Photo Collector Application
This iOS application will allow users to capture and categorize photos within a simple and clean workflow. The minimalist design will make it easier for users who are not technical to gather critical photos. The photos will be stored locally on the device and can be exported as photos with an accompanying textfile defining the results of the categorization or as a KMZ file with the location of each photo included in the capture and categorize process. 

## What is with the Categories?
One of the design motiviations for this application is to provide a way for non-technical end users to collect photos that can be later used to create or refine a machine learning algorithm to automate the detection of categorized photos. The other reason for the categories is to provide a field collection mechanism to quickly sort photos to determine if action is needed (e.g., assessing structures after a natural disaster).

## Designed for Offline
This application is designed to operate without reliable cellular service. All of the photos and the organizational metadata for the photos are stored locally instead of synchronized with a cloud service. This will allow the app to function in many different types of environments.
